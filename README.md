# qton-ui
It is repository for hackathon: Q-ton. 

There is some messy code because we have only 48h to solve: "Try find the best places for objects like sofa, tv, table, chairs and so on by neural network and visualize 'best room' by virtual reality". 

We aimed to create demo which show all features of our solution. 

It is based on react and aframe.
